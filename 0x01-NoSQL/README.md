# NoSQL
Back-end | NoSQL | MongoDB

In this project, I looked at NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB, with a focus on the back-end. The main learning objectives were to understand the concept of NoSQL, distinguish its differences from SQL databases, grasp the concept of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), explore document storage, explore various types of NoSQL databases, and understand the benefits of using NoSQL databases.

The project requirements involved working with MongoDB version 4.2 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for the MongoDB Command Files. For the Python scripts, I used Python version 3.7 and PyMongo version 3.10. To meet the specific guidelines, all files needed to end with a new line, start with a comment, and have a README.md file at the root of the project folder.

Throughout the project, I completed several tasks, each focused on specific database operations with MongoDB:

Task 0: I wrote a script that listed all databases in MongoDB.

Task 1: I created a script that created or used the "my_db" database.

Task 2: I developed a script to insert a document with the attribute "name" and the value "Holberton school" into the "school" collection.

Task 3: I wrote a script that listed all documents in the "school" collection.

Task 4: I created a script to list all documents in the "school" collection with the name "Holberton school."

Task 5: I developed a script to display the number of documents in the "school" collection.

Task 6: I wrote a script that added a new attribute "address" with the value "972 Mission street" to all documents with the name "Holberton school" in the "school" collection.

Task 7: I created a script to delete all documents with the name "Holberton school" in the "school" collection.

Task 8: I developed a Python function that listed all documents in a collection.

Task 9: I wrote a Python function that inserted a new document into a collection based on keyword arguments.

Task 10: I developed a Python function that changed all topics of a school document based on the name.

Task 11: I wrote a Python function that returned the list of schools having a specific topic.

Task 12: I created a Python script that provided stats about Nginx logs stored in MongoDB, such as the number of logs, methods used, and specific methods and paths counts.

Task 13: I developed a script that listed all documents with names starting with "Holberton" in the "school" collection.

Task 14: I wrote a Python function that returned all students sorted by their average scores from the "students" collection.

Task 15: I improved the log_stats script from Task 12 to add the top 10 most present IPs in the "nginx" collection of the "logs" database.

In summary, this project allowed me to gain practical experience in working with MongoDB and Python to perform various NoSQL database operations and analyze logs effectively.
